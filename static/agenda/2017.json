Some popular ORMs (cough Entity Framework cough) place burdensome constraints on DDD implementations, causing them to bend and contort in wierd and less-than-wonderful ways. They can also be sub-optimal for CQRS concerns. CQRS at times is viewed as introducing unwarranted overhead and complexity where it isn't needed.\r\n\r\nIn this session we will explore a less-than-wonderful domain model that utilises a single ORM for all of its concerns, and then look at how we can break it apart utilizing a CQRS approach that employs the best tool for the job for each concern, while keeping complexity to a minimum.",

    "Abstract": "The API economy is here, fueling disruption across many established industries. REST, as specified in Roy Fielding's seminal dissertation, has become the architectural pattern of choice for APIs and when applied correctly allows for clients and servers to evolve in a loosely coupled manner. There are areas however where REST can deliver less than ideal client experiences. Often many HTTP requests are required to render a single view. \r\n\r\nWhile this may be a minor concern for a web app running on a WAN with low latency and high bandwidth, it can yield poor client experiences for mobile clients in particular. GraphQL is Facebook's response to this challenge and it is quickly proving itself as an exciting alternative to RESTful APIs for a wide range of contexts. GraphQL is a query language that provides a clean and simple syntax for consumers to interrogate your APIs. These queries are strongly typed, hierarchical and enable clients to retrieve only the data they need.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we will take a hands-on look at GraphQL and see how it can be used to build APIs that are a joy to use.",

Whether you're fighting the common cold, or trying to remove the ILOVEYOU computer worm from your corporate file server, two things are certain: your immune system is based on your gut health, and computers have really poor gut health.\n\nStopping viruses is hard. The main reason for this is that viruses are really clever. They've evolved over time to escape detection. Each previously detected virus allows the next iteration of the virus to become more resillient. The second reason is that your computer's gut health has to fight every virus, whereas each virus just has to find one immunocompromised system to survive.\n\nLet's work out how viruses hide. How to they sneak past the checkpoints. How they attach themselves to your system. How they fight detection, and removal. We'll look at aspects such as self-replication, cryptographic obfuscation, and touch on methods of delivery and infection.\n\nNow that you're thinking like a virus writer, you can anticipate which areas of your applications need hardening. Just remember, we're doing it for good, not profit :)\n\nThis presentation will feature live demos of writing PHP viruses, and infection of willing targets. The theories apply equally to many languages, so an understanding of PHP is not required.",

    "Abstract": "Populist disruptor IOT solutions have headed down the path of using tiny CPUs or battery powered sensors sending tiny scraps of data through LoraWAN solutions. They claim to be remaking the AgTech landscape in particular. But in the Ag Tech space involving monitoring hot houses, irrigation systems or cool room complexes, there are tons of sensors, often streaming kilobits per hour per sensor and many of them interconnected.\n\nSo how do you build low cost solutions for the client that has affordable bandwidth and can still yield trending data to intelligent dashboards? We'll show you one such solution vertical using a Microsoft stack: OS to cloud. Using a live prototype, we will show you that it is easy to remotely configure and manage data flows in real time with Raspberry Pi3 devices and Microsoft's IoT Azure Suite.\n\nIn addition, we will explain how to use 4G as a coms pipe, yet keeping the costs down to an acceptable level. We will play with the sensors in the session and review the code blocks that deal with the data flow. If you want to learn how to add real data value to IOT solutions, this session is a must.",
