In this talk I will demonstrate creating a conversational user interfaced program that lives in Slack and will use Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to work out what you are asking it to do and act accordingly. I will demonstrate how this can create a low friction interface that can automate mundane or complex tasks and make it feel like you are asking a colleague to help you out.

We'll discuss what happened, and how we worked to fix them. <br /><br />A lot has been learnt, especially in terms of working with the Monolith, and we'd love to share. Something for everyone.",

We'll also look at the future of GraphQL. You'll never look at REST APIs the same way again. Promise.",

In this talk, I’ll delve into why these skills are crucial to being a great developer and how you acquire the skills.",
