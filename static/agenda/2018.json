This is with some short code examples (junior level) and can also include a demo testing of a real live site. \r\n\r\nThe main focus is on the development side of accessibility, as that is where my experience is, but also from the UX, design and project management view point as well.

Fortunately, we've got some great tools for handling asynchronous events....\n\nLike many developers, I first started using the Redux and Observable patterns developing client-side JavaScript / Typescript Single Page Apps.\nBut Rx and Redux libraries exist for many languages.\nThis talk explores implementing Redux behind a SignalR hub on an ASP.Net Core web server, adding predictable state management to the real-time capabilities of SignalR.",

When I started, I was mentored by a very friendly senior developer, which helped with my confidence and made me feel welcomed. I’ve tried to pass on that experience by mentoring new developers on my team, helping them learn and improve as they’re starting out. \r\n\r\nI've always wanted to try and expand that to helping other developers outside of my workplace, so I’ve become a part of Melbourne’s developer and meetup community, having regularly attended DDD Melbourne, presented at DDD by Night, and attended ALT.NET and OWASP meetups. If given the opportunity, presenting at DDD Melbourne will be another step along that path!",

    "Abstract": "Microservices and containers have transformed application design and deployment patterns. Modern cloud native architectures - which underpin many of the world's groundbreaking tech companies such as Uber, Netflix and Airbnb - afford unparalleled levels of agility and scale but are not without trade-offs. In applications comprising hundreds of services (and thousands of service instances), concerns such as security, operability and observability pose significant challenges. Supporting compensating capabilities such as circuit breakers, retry policies and service discovery in each microservice adds undesirable code bloat and impacts our ability to choose the best language for the problem at hand should the required libraries not be available. \r\n\r\nIn this session, we will take an in-depth look at the service mesh pattern; the benefits that a decentralized microservice management approach brings; the best practices that have evolved; and most importantly what you need to know to effectively leverage a service mesh in your architecture:\r\n\r\n- How to determine the suitability of a service mesh for your application context. Don't just drink the cloud native Kool-Aid!\r\n- Disambiguate the overlapping responsibilities of an API gateway and service mesh in a modern architecture and demonstrate how they can be used in harmony.\r\n- How a service mesh enables choosing the best tool or language for a given service without being constrained by the availability of libraries for each platform. Effectively it's a weight loss plan for your microservices.\r\n- What techniques to apply when transitioning to a service mesh based architecture.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we will take a hands-on look at what is involved to build and manage a microservice architecture leveraging Kubernetes and Istio, a leading open source service mesh. By the end of the session, you will not only understand the concepts underpinning the service mesh pattern but also have the knowledge to put them into practice.",

These include exploratory testing, using customer risks to drive your testing, and what to invest your human test effort on in a world where you automate everything\n\nAt the end of this talk, audience members will have an understanding of, including applications and benefits of:\n\n* Manual, human testing\n* Risk-based testing\n* Exploratory testing\n* Automated testing\n* The benefits of all these, and how these can all be used together in waterfall, agile and DevOps environments",
